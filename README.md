# Python Software Quality Evaluator

This project is a simple tool developed during my Bachelorâ€™s to evaluate the quality of Python software. It assesses code quality based on three key metrics:
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**
- **Lines of Code**
- **Number of Bugs**

**Note:** This was implemented purely for academic purposes, so it may not be as refined or optimized as professional-grade tools. I hope, however, that it provides a foundation for others interested in understanding basic code quality metrics.

## Features

1. **Cyclomatic Complexity Analysis**: Measures the complexity of functions or methods in the code, providing insight into potential maintenance challenges.
2. **Lines of Code (LOC)**: Counts the lines of code in each file, giving a general idea of codebase size.
3. **Bug Detection**: Attempts to identify basic bugs in the code, though this feature is limited and may not catch all issues.

## Usage

To use this tool, clone the repository and run the main script. Make sure Python is installed on your machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/salmanriazsyed/python-quality-evaluator.git
cd python-quality-evaluator
python main.py
```

## Limitations

This project was built to demonstrate an understanding of basic software quality metrics and is not meant to replace dedicated quality assessment tools. Some known limitations include:
- Limited bug detection capabilities
- Basic measurement of complexity without in-depth analysis
- Lack of comprehensive error handling and reporting

## Future Improvements

If I revisit this project, possible improvements could include:
- Enhanced bug detection using static analysis libraries
- Better handling of nested and complex structures for more accurate complexity scoring
- A more user-friendly interface and detailed reporting

This project is open for anyone interested, and contributions or feedback are welcome!
